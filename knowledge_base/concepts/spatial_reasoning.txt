Spatial reasoning encompasses the ability to understand and manipulate spatial relationships:

Core Components:
1. Mental Rotation: Ability to rotate objects mentally in 3D space
2. Spatial Visualization: Creating and manipulating mental images
3. Spatial Relations: Understanding positional relationships between objects
4. Pattern Recognition: Identifying geometric and spatial patterns

Key Applications:
- Geometric Problem Solving
- Navigation and Pathfinding
- Visual-Spatial Memory
- Dimensional Analysis
- Spatial Perspective Taking

Fundamental Principles:
- Reference Frame Theory
- Mental Model Construction
- Spatial Transformation
- Visual Working Memory
- Geometric Invariance
