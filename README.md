# Cascade of Semantically Integrated Layers (CSIL)

## Overview

The **Cascade of Semantically Integrated Layers (CSIL)** is an advanced multi-layer semantic analysis system designed to generate contextually rich and semantically meaningful responses. It processes user input and knowledge base content through multiple semantic layers, integrating dynamic corpus management, adaptive semantic analysis, and knowledge graph integration. The result is a system that understands and responds to queries with depth and nuance.

## How It Works

CSIL operates by breaking down the processing of user input into four sequential layers, each building upon the previous one:

### 1. Initial Understanding

- **Objective**: Extract fundamental concepts from the user input.
- **Process**:
  - Use techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to identify key terms.
  - Apply Named Entity Recognition (NER) to detect entities like people, places, and organizations.
  - Filter out common stopwords to focus on meaningful content.
- **Outcome**: A set of core concepts and questions identified from the input.

### 2. Relationship Analysis

- **Objective**: Discover semantic connections between the extracted concepts.
- **Process**:
  - Calculate semantic similarity between concepts.
  - Utilize a knowledge graph to identify and map relationships.
  - Cluster related concepts to understand their interconnections.
- **Outcome**: A network of related concepts highlighting how they interact.

### 3. Context Integration

- **Objective**: Incorporate broader context and additional information not initially present.
- **Process**:
  - Integrate historical and background knowledge from a knowledge base.
  - Adjust context dynamically based on the conversation's progression.
  - Apply weighting to emphasize the most relevant context.
- **Outcome**: An enriched understanding of the query with added depth and background.

### 4. Response Synthesis

- **Objective**: Generate a cohesive and contextually appropriate response.
- **Process**:
  - Synthesize information from all previous layers.
  - Adjust the response style and tone according to the context.
  - Utilize templates and dynamic parameters to refine the output.
- **Outcome**: A well-crafted response that addresses the user's query comprehensively.

## Key Components

### Semantic Layer Processing

The core of CSIL is its layered approach to semantic processing. Each layer refines the understanding of the user input, ensuring that the final response is accurate and nuanced.

```python
def process_semantic_cascade(self, user_input: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Multi-layer semantic processing pipeline.
    """
    # Initialize results
    results = {
        'initial_understanding': '',
        'relationships': '',
        'context_integration': '',
        'final_response': '',
        'metadata': {
            'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
            'concepts_extracted': [],
            'similarity_scores': {}
        }
    }
    
    # Sequentially process each layer
    results['initial_understanding'] = self._process_layer(
        "initial_understanding",
        user_input,
        "",
        "Identify the fundamental concepts and questions."
    )
    results['relationships'] = self._process_layer(
        "relationship_analysis",
        user_input,
        results['initial_understanding'],
        "Discover connections between the identified concepts."
    )
    results['context_integration'] = self._process_layer(
        "contextual_integration",
        user_input,
        results['relationships'],
        "Add broader context and implications not yet discussed."
    )
    results['final_response'] = self._process_layer(
        "synthesis",
        user_input,
        results['context_integration'],
        "Create a cohesive response that builds upon all previous layers."
    )
    
    return results
```

### Knowledge Graph Integration

CSIL maintains a knowledge graph that tracks concepts and their relationships, enhancing its ability to provide contextually relevant responses.

```python
def _update_knowledge_graph(self, concepts: List[str], relationships: List[Tuple[str, str, float]]) -> None:
    """
    Update the internal knowledge graph with new concepts and relationships.
    """
    # Add or update concepts
    for concept in concepts:
        if concept not in self.knowledge_graph:
            self.knowledge_graph.add_node(
                concept, 
                first_seen=datetime.now(),
                frequency=1
            )
        else:
            self.knowledge_graph.nodes[concept]['frequency'] += 1
                
    # Add or update relationships
    for c1, c2, weight in relationships:
        if self.knowledge_graph.has_edge(c1, c2):
            current_weight = self.knowledge_graph[c1][c2]['weight']
            new_weight = (current_weight + weight) / 2
            self.knowledge_graph[c1][c2]['weight'] = new_weight
        else:
            self.knowledge_graph.add_edge(c1, c2, weight=weight)
```

### Dynamic Configuration

The system allows for fine-tuning through a dynamic configuration setup, enabling adjustments to thresholds, processing options, and layer-specific parameters.

```python
@dataclass
class CSILConfig:
    """Configuration for semantic layer processing."""
    # Core parameters
    min_keywords: int = 2
    max_keywords: int = 20
    keyword_weight_threshold: float = 0.1
    similarity_threshold: float = 0.1
    max_results: Optional[int] = None
    
    # LLM configuration
    llm_config: LLMConfig = field(default_factory=LLMConfig)
    
    # Processing options
    debug_mode: bool = False
    use_external_knowledge: bool = field(
        default_factory=lambda: os.getenv('USE_EXTERNAL_KNOWLEDGE', 'false').lower() == 'true'
    )
    
    # Layer-specific thresholds
    layer_thresholds: Dict[str, float] = field(
        default_factory=lambda: {
            "initial_understanding": 0.7,
            "relationship_analysis": 0.7,
            "contextual_integration": 0.9,
            "synthesis": 0.8
        }
    )
    
    # Adaptive processing
    adaptive_thresholds: bool = True
    min_threshold: float = 0.1
    max_threshold: float = 0.9
    threshold_step: float = 0.05
```

## Technical Features

### Advanced Vectorization

Utilizing TF-IDF vectorization and custom tokenization to extract meaningful concepts from text.

```python
class SemanticVectorizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(
            max_features=500,
            ngram_range=(1, 1),
            token_pattern=r'(?u)\b\w+\b',
            strip_accents='unicode'
        )
```

### Knowledge Graph Analysis

Analyzing the knowledge graph to determine the most central concepts and communities within the graph.

```python
def analyze_knowledge_graph(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Analyze the knowledge graph state and metrics."""
    return {
        'num_concepts': self.knowledge_graph.number_of_nodes(),
        'central_concepts': nx.pagerank(self.knowledge_graph),
        'communities': list(nx.community.greedy_modularity_communities(
            self.knowledge_graph.to_undirected()
        ))
    }
```
